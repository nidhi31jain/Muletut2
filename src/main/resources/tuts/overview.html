	<div>Mule is the lightweight integration runtime engine that
		allows you to connect anything, anywhere. Rather than creating
		multiple point-to-point integrations between systems, services, APIs,
		and devices, use Mule to intelligently manage message routing, data
		mapping, orchestration, reliability, security, and scalability between
		nodes. Plug other systems and applications into Mule and let it handle
		communication between systems, allowing you to track and monitor your
		application ecosystem and external resources.</div>

	<h3>What is ESB?</h3>
	<div>An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is fundamentally an
		architecture. It is a set of rules and principles for integrating
		numerous applications together over a bus-like infrastructure. ESB
		products enable users to build this type of architecture, but vary in
		the way that they do it and the capabilities that they offer. The core
		concept of the ESB architecture is that you integrate different
		applications by putting a communication bus between them and then
		enable each application to talk to the bus. This decouples systems
		from each other, allowing them to communicate without dependency on or
		knowledge of other systems on the bus.</div>

	<h3>Why Mule?</h3>
	<div>Mule is lightweight but highly scalable, allowing you to
		start small and connect more applications over time. The ESB manages
		all the interactions between applications and components
		transparently, regardless of whether they exist in the same virtual
		machine or over the Internet, and regardless of the underlying
		transport protocol used. There are currently several commercial ESB
		implementations on the market. However, many of these provide limited
		functionality or are built on top of an existing application server or
		messaging server, locking you into that specific vendor. Mule is
		vendor-neutral, so different vendor implementations can plug in to it.
		You are never locked in to a specific vendor when you use Mule.</div>
