		Mule can process message in batches. It has the ability split payload
		into a batch of records and process them, report them or just push to
		another system. This is particularly handy when processing a large
		file or a large set of data from database.
		<p>A batch job is an independent block of code with four phases.</p>
		<ul class="post-list">
			<li>Input: Have a message or source or series of processors to
				prepare data.</li>
			<li>Load and Dispatch: Mule splits the payload into a collection
				and save them in queue. It is an implicit phase.</li>
			<li>Process: Each records is processed asynchronously and moves
				through the processors.</li>
			<li>Complete: Reports summary of records processed. This phase
				can be used to get some insight into the processed records.</li>
		</ul>
		A Batch Job can be triggered via
		<ul class="post-list">
			<li>A Batch Execute element, to reference the Batch Job from a
				flow</li>
			<li>Placing an inbound one way source like File or FTP in the
				input section of Batch Job</li>
		</ul>
