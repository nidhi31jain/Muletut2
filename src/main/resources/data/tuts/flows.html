		A mule application can have one or more flow. The application accepts
		a message through an inbound endpoint in a flow and processes the
		message through a series of processors.<br> Typically, a flow has
		<ul class="post-list">
			<li>A message source for accepting a message.</li>
			<li>Message Processor(s) to process the message.</li>
			<li>Can have an exception strategy also for better error
				handling.</li>
		</ul>
		A flow can either process the message by itself or route the message
		to other flows or sub flows to perform specific tasks.
		Simply, a flow is a chain of message processors.
		<p class="alert alert-info">Flows without message source are
			called private flows.</p>

	<h3>Sub Flow</h3>
	<div>
		<ul class="post-list">
			<li>Promotes code reuse, avoid code redundancy</li>
			<li>It processes messages synchronously, i.e; in the same
				thread.</li>
			<li>Inherits the exception strategy and processing strategy of
				the calling flow.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="alert alert-info">A single flow can reference to several sub
			flows and a sub flow can be referenced by several flows.</p>

		Larger flows should be broken into multiple flows and sub flows if possible, it makes for a cleaner view.
		<ul class="post-list">
			<li>Makes the graphical view easy to use and understand.</li>
			<li>XML code is easier to read.</li>
			<li>Easier to test.</li>
			<li>Code reuse.</li>
		</ul>
