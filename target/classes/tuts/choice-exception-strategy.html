		A Choice Exception Strategy handles an exception based on the
		message's content. It catches the exception, checks the exception type
		using a MEL expression and content of the message, and then maps the
		exception to appropriate exception strategy.<br>It's like
		multiple catch blocks in Java.
		<p class="alert alert-info">A Choice Exception Strategy cannot
			have another Choice Exception Strategy inside it.</p>
