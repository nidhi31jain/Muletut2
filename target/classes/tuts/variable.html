		Variables, as known to everybody, are used to save some value.<br>Mule
		have 3 type of variables
		<ul class="post-list">
			<li>Flow variables</li>
			<li>Session variables</li>
			<li>Record variables (Will be discussed in batch processing)</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Flow Variable</h3>
	<div>
		Flow variables are tied to the message as it moves in a flow. When the
		message leaves the flow, the flow variables cease to exist.The scope
		of flow variables is limited to the flow only. A variable transformer
		is used to set or remove flow variables.<img
			src="images/variable-1.JPG" class="post-img img-responsive"><br>MEL
		expressions can also be given as value like
		<code>#[message.inboundProperties.'http.listener.path']</code>
		.<br>Flow variables is accessed using
		<code>#[flowVars.myVar]</code>
		<p class="alert alert-danger">Don't write the value in quotes as
			it will become part of the value too.</p>
	</div>
</section>
<section>
	<h3>Session Variable</h3>
	<div>
		Use a session variable transformer to set or remove a session variable
		which is tied to the message for its entire life cycle, across
		multiple flows.<img src="images/variable-2.JPG"
			class="post-img img-responsive"> <br>Session variables is
		accessed using
		<code>#[sessionVars.mySessionVar]</code>
		<p class="alert alert-info">Session variables can be propagated
			using VM or flow references, but not HTTP connectors.</p>
		<p class="alert alert-info">The variable value is String by default, to convert it to integer use MEL expression. Write like #[1].</p>
